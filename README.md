# Ames-House-Prices-Multiple-Linear-Regression-Project-in-Python
Give Ames Housing dataset, an exploratory data analysis was firstly conducted to identify and missing values, suspicious data, and redundant variables. Then I evaluated a pool of candidate multiple linear regression models and select the best model based on AIC, BIC, and adjust R-squared. With the best model selected, the model assumptions were checked regarding normality, homoscedasticity, collinearity, and linearity between response and predictors. Several solutions were proposed to solve the assumption violation.
